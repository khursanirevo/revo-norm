"""
Pronunciation mappings for TTS (Text-to-Speech) applications.

⚠️  TTS-ONLY: This module maps terms to their **spoken pronunciation**, NOT their
    expanded meaning. For example:
    - ✅ "GUI" → "gooey" (how you SAY it)
    - ✅ "IEEE" → "I triple E" (how you SAY it)
    - ✅ "Hj" → "Haji" (how you PRONOUNCE the abbreviation)
    - ❌ "AMN" → "Ahli Mangku Negara" (what it MEANS, not pronunciation)

    Adding abbreviation expansions here will produce incorrect TTS output.
    Use `add_custom_mapping()` to add new entries — it validates against
    expansions that look like abbreviation lookups rather than pronunciation.

These mappings have the HIGHEST PRIORITY in the normalization pipeline and are
applied BEFORE any other transformations (acronym expansion, abbreviation
expansion, etc.).

# Tech terms are pronounced the same way in both languages for Malaysian context
#
# GUIDELINES for adding entries:
# 1. The mapping must represent how a term SOUNDS when spoken aloud
# 2. The replacement should be similar length to the spoken form
# 3. Multi-word expansions (like "Ahli Mangku Negara") are abbreviation
#    expansions, NOT pronunciation — they do NOT belong here
