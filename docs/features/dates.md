# Date Normalization

## Overview

Date normalization converts written date expressions into their spoken form for TTS. It supports multiple common date formats, bilingual output for English and Malay, and automatic disambiguation between DD/MM and MM/DD formats.

Dates are extracted as entities early in the pipeline to prevent the fraction normalizer from misinterpreting date separators (e.g., `15/08` as a fraction).

## Supported Formats

| Format | Example | Notes |
|--------|---------|-------|
| DD/MM/YYYY | `15/08/2025` | Day first when day > 12 |
| MM/DD/YYYY | `08/15/2025` | Month first when month <= 12 |
| YYYY-MM-DD | `2025-08-15` | ISO format |
| DD Month YYYY | `15 August 2025` | Full or abbreviated month names |
| Month DD, YYYY | `August 15, 2025` | Full or abbreviated month names |

Month abbreviations are also recognized: `Jan`, `Feb`, `Mar`, `Apr`, `May`, `Jun`, `Jul`, `Aug`, `Sep`, `Oct`, `Nov`, `Dec`.

## DD/MM vs MM/DD Ambiguity

When the slash format is used and the first number is greater than 12, it is unambiguously treated as DD/MM/YYYY (day/month/year). When both numbers are 12 or less, the format is treated as MM/DD/YYYY.

| Input | Interpretation | Reason |
|-------|---------------|--------|
| `15/08/2025` | DD/MM/YYYY | 15 cannot be a month |
| `08/15/2025` | MM/DD/YYYY | 15 cannot be a month |
| `05/08/2025` | MM/DD/YYYY | Ambiguous -- defaults to MM/DD |

## English Output

```python
from revo_norm import normalize_text

# Slash format (DD/MM, day > 12)
normalize_text("15/08/2025", language="en")
# "fifteen of August two thousand twenty five"

# Slash format (MM/DD, ambiguous)
normalize_text("08/15/2025", language="en")
# "August fifteen, two thousand twenty five"

# ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
normalize_text("2025-08-15", language="en")
# "August the fifteenth, two thousand twenty five"
```

## Malay Output

Malay uses localized month names and Malay number-to-words conversion.

### Malay Month Names

| Number | English    | Malay      |
|--------|-----------|------------|
| 01     | January   | Januari    |
| 02     | February  | Februari   |
| 03     | March     | Mac        |
| 04     | April     | April      |
| 05     | May       | Mei        |
| 06     | June      | Jun        |
| 07     | July      | Julai      |
| 08     | August    | Ogos       |
| 09     | September | September  |
| 10     | October   | Oktober    |
| 11     | November  | November   |
| 12     | December  | Disember   |

```python
from revo_norm import normalize_text

# Slash format (DD/MM)
normalize_text("15/08/2025", language="ms")
# "lima belas Ogos dua ribu dua puluh lima"

# Slash format (MM/DD, ambiguous)
normalize_text("08/15/2025", language="ms")
# "Ogos lima belas, dua ribu dua puluh lima"

# ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
normalize_text("2025-08-15", language="ms")
# "lima belas Ogos dua ribu dua puluh lima"
```

## How to Disable

```python
from revo_norm import normalize_text

# Disable date normalization
result = normalize_text("15/08/2025", language="en", disable=["dates"])
# The date is still extracted as an entity for protection,
# but restored as the original text instead of spoken form.

# Use minimal profile (dates not spoken)
result = normalize_text("15/08/2025", language="en", profile="minimal")
```

When dates are disabled, they are still extracted from the text to protect them from being mangled by other normalizers (e.g., the fraction normalizer). However, they are restored as their original text rather than converted to spoken form.

## Edge Cases

- **Two-digit years**: `15/08/25` is matched, but four-digit years produce better spoken output.
- **Single-digit day/month**: `5/8/2025` is recognized the same as `05/08/2025`.
- **Month name variations**: Both `Aug` and `August` are recognized. The full name is used in output.
- **Trailing dot on month**: `Aug. 15, 2025` is recognized.
- **Date vs fraction conflict**: Dates are extracted before fractions run, so `15/08/2025` is never misinterpreted as a fraction.
- **Dates in URLs**: URL extraction runs before date extraction, so dates inside URLs are handled as part of the URL, not as standalone dates.
